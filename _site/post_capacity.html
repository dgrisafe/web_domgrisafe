<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Capacity is a functional assessment regarding a particular decision
at a particular point in time.</p>
<p><em>Capacity</em> is determined:</p>
<ul>
<li>At a specific time</li>
<li>For a given procedure or treatment</li>
<li>By the provider offering the intervention</li>
</ul>
<p>There is a presumption of capacity by default. Providers only need to
document capacity following a formal capacity evaluation, or if the
patient has regained capacity following a period of lacking it.</p>
<div id="pillars-of-medical-ethics" class="section level3">
<h3>Pillars of Medical Ethics</h3>
<p>Throughout this discussion, it is helpful to recall the 4 pillars of
medical ethics outlined in the <a
href="https://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/regulations-and-policy/belmont-report/read-the-belmont-report/index.html">Belmont
Report</a>:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Respect for persons (Autonomy)</li>
<li>Beneficence</li>
<li>Nonmaleficence</li>
<li>Justice</li>
</ol>
</div>
</div>
<div id="applebaum-criteria-for-capacity" class="section level2">
<h2>Applebaum Criteria for Capacity</h2>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Communicate a <em>Clear and Consistent</em> Choice</li>
<li>Understand Relevant Information</li>
<li>Appreciate Ramifications of Procedure</li>
<li>Reasoning Intact</li>
</ol>
<p>Patients are assumed to lack capacity until a provider performs a
formal evaluation.</p>
<p>i.e., Patients are “guilty until proven innocent” with respect to
capacity.</p>
<p><em><a href="https://doi.org/10.1056/NEJM198812223192504">Applebaum
Criteria</a></em> are formally assessed to determine capacity using the
<em><a href="https://doi.org/10.1176/ps.48.11.1415">MacArthur Competence
Assessment</a></em>.</p>
<p>The criteria are in ascending order of difficulty to assess.</p>
<div id="communicate-a-clear-and-consistent-choice"
class="section level3">
<h3>1. Communicate a <em>Clear and Consistent</em> Choice</h3>
<p>The easiest criteria to assess</p>
<p>A patient lacks capacity if they cannot communicate a clear
choice.</p>
<p>e.g., A patient in a coma that cannot speak.</p>
<p>A patient lacks capacity if they change their mind about a treatment
without being presented with additional information or explaining a new
thought processes.</p>
</div>
<div id="understand-relevant-information" class="section level3">
<h3>2. Understand Relevant Information</h3>
<p>Patients have capacity to accept or decline a treatment when they can
explain the <em>risks</em>, <em>benefits</em>, and
<em>alternatives</em>.</p>
<p>Medical providers can often determine this aspect of capacity.</p>
<p>Providers often focus on the patient’s understanding, but this is not
sufficient to determine capacity.</p>
<p>Helpful questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>“Why are you in the hospital?”</li>
<li>“What did your doctors tell you was going on?”</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="appreciate-ramifications-of-procedure" class="section level3">
<h3>3. Appreciate Ramifications of Procedure</h3>
<p>The patient with capacity appreciates that risks are genuine and that
they apply to themselves.</p>
<p>e.g., A patient lacking capacity might say, “Sure the operation is
risky, but <em>I</em> would never die during neurosurgery!”</p>
<p>A patient would also lack capacity if they minimize the risk that a
treatment may have on their wellbeing.</p>
<p>e.g., A patient lacking capacity might state, “Losing a limb would be
fine. I would live the same life I have now.”</p>
<p>Helpful questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>“What are some of the things that could happen if you
<em>didn’t</em> have [this intervention]?”</li>
<li>“What did your doctors tell you could happen? Do you believe
that?”</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="reasoning-intact" class="section level3">
<h3>4. Reasoning Intact</h3>
<p>The most difficult criteria to assess</p>
<p>Can they explain <em>why</em> they are making their choice?</p>
<p>Is the patient making a unique decision that someone from their
community would never choose?</p>
<p>e.g., A patient with throat cancer was refusing a biopsy and
chemotherapy, but accepted radiation because they believed this modality
was a magical cure-all.</p>
<p>If something doesn’t feel right, dig further.</p>
<p>Helpful questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>“What makes you prefer [intervention A] over [intervention B]?”</li>
<li>“What led you to make this decision?”</li>
</ul>
<div id="e.g.-kidney-donation-due-to-psychotic-reasoning"
class="section level4">
<h4>e.g., Kidney Donation due to Psychotic Reasoning</h4>
<p>A 30 year old female wanted to generously donate her kidney to a
child in the neighborhood who was at risk of death from renal
failure.</p>
<p>On evaluation, the team learned the patient wanted to donate only her
left kidney because she believed there was a demon living within this
part of her body.</p>
<p>She believed donation was the only way to exercise the spirit from
her body.</p>
<p>This patient lacked capacity because of her psychotic thought process
despite a superficially noble act.</p>
</div>
<div id="religious-exemption-to-intact-reasoning"
class="section level4">
<h4>Religious Exemption to Intact Reasoning</h4>
<p>e.g., Jehovah’s Witness belong to a community that rejects blood
products. They have capacity to refuse blood infusions, even if it would
prevent their death from blood loss during surgery.</p>
<p>A caveat is the person must hold these values at baseline.</p>
<p>i.e., They cannot have adopted religious values at the moment they
have their procedure.</p>
<p>e.g., A manic patient that is refusing IV antibiotics for sepsis due
to their religious faith that they adopted that day lacks capacity.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div id="capacity-is-not" class="section level2">
<h2>Capacity is <em>Not</em>…</h2>
<p>Specific <em>Pathologies</em> do not automatically determine
capacity; myriad etiologies can exclude a patient from having
capacity.</p>
<p>An capacity evaluation is required for each patient, for each
treatment, at each moment it is offered.</p>
<div id="capacity-is-not-informed-consent" class="section level3">
<h3>Capacity is <em>Not</em> Informed Consent</h3>
<p>Completing informed consent does not satisfy an evaluation of
capacity.</p>
</div>
<div id="capacity-is-not-the-absence-of-mental-illness"
class="section level3">
<h3>Capacity is <em>Not</em> the Absence of Mental Illness</h3>
<p><em>Psychiatric Illness</em> does not mean a patient lacks
capacity.</p>
<p>Capacity must be formally evaluated for each procedure at the time it
is offered.</p>
<p>e.g., Capacity is difficult to determine for a depressed patient with
a terminal illness pursing comfort care as a passive way to end their
life.</p>
</div>
<div id="capacity-determined-by-psychiatry-is-not-a-legal-protection"
class="section level3">
<h3>Capacity Determined by Psychiatry is <em>Not</em> a Legal
Protection</h3>
<p>The psychiatry service may be consulted for a second opinion of
capacity, but this does not protect the primary team from liability;
psychiatry is <em>not</em> responsible for capacity.</p>
<p>e.g., Neurology is responsible for determining capacity if they want
to offer a lumbar puncture.</p>
</div>
<div id="capacity-is-not-competency" class="section level3">
<h3>Capacity is <em>Not</em> Competency</h3>
<p><em>Capacity</em> is a medical definition determined by a
physician.</p>
<p><em>Competency</em> is a legal definition determined by a judge or
lawyer.</p>
<p><em>Capacity</em> is short-term, at a specific moment, while
<em>Competency</em> is long-term, for a defined duration.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="timeline-for-capacity" class="section level2">
<h2>Timeline for Capacity</h2>
<p>If there is an imminent loss of life or limb to the patient,
providers may proceed with standard of care to improve a patient’s
health.</p>
<p>Hospital policy sometimes requires two physicians to sign if a
patient lacks capacity for a high risk treatment, but this is not a
legal requirement.</p>
</div>
<div id="surrogate-decision-maker-illinois-health-care-surrogate-act"
class="section level2">
<h2>Surrogate Decision Maker: Illinois Health Care Surrogate Act</h2>
<p>The State of Illinois has clarified a patient’s surrogate decision
maker in the <a
href="https://www.ilga.gov/legislation/ilcs/ilcs3.asp?ActID=2111&amp;ChapterID=60">Health
Care Surrogate Act (755 ILCS 40/1)</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“for patients who lack decisional capacity and have a qualifying
condition, medical treatment decisions including whether to forgo
life-sustaining treatment on behalf of the patient may be made without
court order or judicial involvement in the following order of
priority:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>the patient’s guardian of the person;</li>
<li>the patient’s spouse;</li>
<li>any adult son or daughter of the patient;</li>
<li>either parent of the patient;</li>
<li>any adult brother or sister of the patient;</li>
<li>any adult grandchild of the patient;</li>
<li>a close friend of the patient;</li>
<li>the patient’s guardian of the estate;</li>
<li>the patient’s temporary custodian appointed…”</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>Note, if multiple family members are involved, ask the group to
identify one person to make medical decision makers and liaison
communication between the group and the providers.</p>
<div id="exceptions-to-surrogate-decision-maker" class="section level3">
<h3>Exceptions to Surrogate Decision Maker</h3>
<div id="futility-of-treatment" class="section level4">
<h4>Futility of Treatment</h4>
<p>e.g., Surrogate decision maker says to do CPR, but the patient is
already dead</p>
</div>
<div id="sterilization" class="section level4">
<h4>Sterilization</h4>
<p>Parents cannot force their children to be sterilized against their
will.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div id="substituted-judgement" class="section level2">
<h2>Substituted Judgement</h2>
<p>Medical decision makers must do their best to make choices based on
their familiarity with the patient’s judgement.</p>
<p>Ethically, decision makers should do their best to substitute the
patient’s judgement for their own when making decisions on behalf of a
patient lacking capacity.</p>
<p>A new surrogate should be identified if the existing medical decision
maker is unable to substitute the patient’s judgement for their own.</p>
<p>The surrogate decision maker is not legally required to use
substituted judgement; if this is the case:</p>
<ul>
<li>Maintain continuous conversation with the decision maker</li>
<li>Consider calling an <em>ethics committee</em></li>
</ul>
<div id="e.g.-jehovahs-witness-wife-of-surgery-patient"
class="section level3">
<h3>e.g., Jehovah’s Witness Wife of Surgery Patient</h3>
<p>The wife of an obtunded patient was Jehovah’s Witness, but the
patient was Presbyterian.</p>
<p>The wife insisted her unconscious husband not receive blood products
during his life-saving operation, but she could not explain that the
patient would have wanted this using his own judgement.</p>
<p>She repeatedly demanded the providers not give her spouse blood
products of any kind.</p>
<p>It appeared to the providers that she may have been unable to
substitute the patient’s judgement for her own by refusing blood
products for the patient.</p>
<p>Eventually, the surgeons opted to conserve blood during the operation
and were able to successfully complete the surgery without blood
products.</p>
<p>When the patient returned to consciousness, he explained that he had
promised the wife he would never receive blood products, and they would
be conditionally divorced if he ever violated this agreement.</p>
<p>The decision maker was using substituted judgement, but she was
unable to explain her rationale to the providers.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="best-interest-model" class="section level2">
<h2>“Best Interest” Model</h2>
<p>When there is no decision maker, consulting providers may act in the
best interest of the patient.</p>
<p>Treating physicians may act in a way that they deem reasonable.</p>
<p>Providers are unable to use substituted judgement in the “Best
Interest” model because the providers are unfamiliar with the patient’s
values.</p>
<p>This option is less ideal for making treatment decisions on behalf of
the patient.</p>
<p>Therefore, it is reserved for cases where patient’s lack a medical
decision maker.</p>
</div>
<div id="threshold-for-capacity" class="section level2">
<h2>Threshold for Capacity</h2>
<p>Providers must balance the risk of a treatment with the benefit it
would provide the patient.</p>
<div id="sliding-scale" class="section level3">
<h3>Sliding Scale</h3>
<p>A patient may have capacity to accept a treatment at a given snapshot
in time, while lacking capacity to refuse the same treatment.</p>
